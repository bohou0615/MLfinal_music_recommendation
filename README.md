# MLfinal_music_recommendation

# Abstract
We try to use the dataset in WSDM - KKBox's Music Recommendation Challenge as our topic.\
We first preprocess the data and find what kinds of information are useful or redundant to optimize the best performance. Then, we implement different types of model to get the best score on the validation. \
The details are commented in the file.\
Although time is not enough and the method is limited to get the best accuracy, we use what we learn in the class to reach 0.65 in the accuracy.
